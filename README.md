- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoSRS, I had nothing to do with programming before, but I'll try to learn and be productive as much as I can.
- 👀 I’m interested in learn coding, web design and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, but hopefully soon!
- 📫 How to reach me is a mistery.
- ⚡ Fun fact: All the electricity powering the internet weighs the same as an apricot.
